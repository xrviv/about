Welcome to the edge of verifiability.

This is a space where code isn’t just written—it’s interrogated. Every repository, every script, every analysis serves a single purpose: to uncover the truth in software. Whether it's dissecting Android wallets, verifying reproducibility, or automating deep-dive inspections, the goal remains the same: No assumptions. Only evidence.

Expect repositories filled with:

- ✔️ Automated build verification tools 
- ✔️ Forensic-level software analysis
- ✔️ Cryptography-adjacent investigations
- ✔️ Containers, scripts, and automation—built for reproducibility

If it can be faked, it can be proven.

If it can be obfuscated, it can be revealed.

Source code tells a story. Here, we make sure it's the right one.
